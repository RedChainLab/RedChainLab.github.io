### Overview

The third RedChainLab Workshop will take place on October 30 and 31 2024 in Lyon, France, marking another significant milestone in the journey of the RedChainLab project.

Since its inception three years ago, the workshop has become a premier forum for high-profile researchers from both academia and industry to share their knowledge and collaborate on cutting-edge technologies. This year, the workshop will once again cover a wide range of topics, including blockchain, decentralized cloud computing, edge computing, security, and federated learning.

RedChainLab is a joint research initiative between iExec Blockchain Tech, a pioneering SME based in Lyon, and the DRIM research team at the LIRIS CNRS laboratory (LIRIS-UMR 5205). Together, these two major players in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes digital innovation ecosystem are working on a bold vision‚Äîto develop scalable, trusted, and privacy-preserving decentralized marketplaces.

iExec Blockchain Tech, founded in 2016, has been building decentralized cloud computing infrastructure. Using Ethereum blockchain, iExec developed a platform for sharing resources without intermediaries, enabling new applications while addressing challenges like scalability, trust, and confidentiality.¬†The RedChainLab project addresses key challenges for creating a decentralized marketplace, including blockchain scalability, establishing trust, and ensuring data confidentiality. This year‚Äôs workshop will discuss ongoing research, share insights, and explore solutions to these challenges.


Participants can expect to engage in in-depth discussions on the progress of RedChainLab's research agenda, which focuses on pushing the limits of blockchain scalability, developing mechanisms to guarantee trust in multi-blockchain environments, and preserving the privacy of participants and data within decentralized marketplaces. These discussions will contribute to shaping the future of decentralized cloud solutions and strengthening the foundation for a more open, resilient, and transparent digital economy.

Join us in Lyon to be a part of this dynamic exchange of ideas and contribute to shaping the future of blockchain-based decentralized systems.
